New publication on automated training of ML interatomic potentials

---

We have published a paper on our code [autoplex](https://github.com/autoatml/autoplex) together with [Volker Deringer](https://www.chem.ox.ac.uk/people/volker-deringer)'s group at the University of Oxford.

Please find the publication here: [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-62510-6](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-62510-6)
